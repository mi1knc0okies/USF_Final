        <p>
            The final task was pretty straight forward and pretty easy since it was a continuation of our past projects. Working with javascript was fun and different. Wish we could
            have done more of that in this class. The wire framing and project plan through me off as but was also fun and different. The overall project was not more difficult than
            past projects, but it did allow me to have some time to work on formatting and clean up my css. It definitely helps that I have a background in this subject already so most
            of the task were pretty easy, and I understand they were meant for someone who has absolutely no knowledge of website design to be able to do. I am looking forward to continuing
            my education in this field and hope to take more advance classes to enhance the skills I have already and broaden my knowledge to get more advanced programming jobs.
        </p>

            The class was good and the videos were very solid. They explained a lot of how and why things worked, compared to other classes I have taken the videos were very helpful and
            was as good as an in person experience. I maybe a little bias as this is a topic I have a bit of interest in so that may have help with keeping my attention.
        </p>

            One thing I definitely learned about myself that I may have already known but didn't realize how much I will obsess over perfecting my layout. Since a lot of the work on this project
            was already done in past projects I spent most of my time trying to perfect color coronations and align my layout. Get all the columns to line up as well as make sure things are evenly
            spaced. I can probably spend another week just tweaking things. I understand that these are not specific things I am graded on but just having a beautiful user experience is something
            I strive for in any design project I work on. It is definitely something I thoroughly enjoyed as well.

        <p>
           This was a bit challenging trying to get my side columns to line up and be the proper length. Trying to adjust the minimum height to the same length across all the
            columns did not work one would be longer than the other even though they were set the same. I dont think I double-checked the spacing from the top but as of writing
            I am happy with where my webpage is. It has been a while since I made a layout from scratch so it was fun and very challenging to go this far as I have never had to do a
            layout with multiple columns setup through the css. I'm not very happy with the iframe sidebar for my links from a personal standpoint but I think it looks much better now
            than before. Getting the image map coordinates to line up was also a bit of a challenge and a bit time-consuming but I feel like the image map and the columns through css will
            be items that I will use in the near future in future projects. At first, I didn't understand where I would use the image map but I found a creative use for it as the entry
            page for my website. I hope that my professor finds it creative and fitting of his requirements.
            <br><br>
            The thing I hate the most about iframes is that it is difficult to link to a page you want to go to while keeping the iframe menu without making an extra html page. Pretty inconvenient
            and a waste of time.
            <br><br>
            I definitely should of gave myself a little more time to work on this as I feel like I could have challenged myself a bit moe to make the website look the way I wanted it. Looking
            ahead at the next project and the fact it has javascript involved, I will definitely start a bit earlier.

        <p>
            I have worked with old framesets in the past, and it was interesting trying to make iframes work in the way I want. Still some tinkering needed to really get
            the pages to look the way I want and not sure if the changes I want need to be done through the style sheet or directly in the html surrounding the iframe code.
            Something weird that I encountered was the order of the iframes causing me to not be able to click on my menu section. I spent easily 30minutes to maybe an hour trying
            to figure it out then just swapped the order of the code then suddenly it worked.
            <br><br>
            Outside of adding the framesets there was not much of a huge change or adjustment from what I had already submitted for SUS. I had already used an external style sheet
            in the first project so copying my style sheet to be placed as an internal style sheet saved me a lot of time. This was a pretty simple project but getting everything align
            correctly after implementing framesets took the majority of my time. I am looking forward to the next project.

            There is not a lot for me to reflect on in this project. I deal with coding and using FTP/SSH applications daily. I use a mac and prefer Cyber Duck or Fetch over
            Filezilla from having bad experiences with bloatware being installed with the program on Windows machines. For the most part this was a pretty straight
            forward exercise for me. It gave me a chance to brush up on a few skills I really haven't needed to use in a while.</p>
        <p>
            This is the first time in a while that I have designed a website from scratch. I enjoyed it much more than taking an existing website template and trying to edit it
            to fit my needs. I am looking forward to our next project as this type of work is what I enjoy and why I am passionate about making a career out of it.

            After uploading my files to the site I noticed the images load a little slow. Not sure if that is a USF server issue or if maybe I should of used smaller image files.
        <br>
            I'll blame USF's servers for now.
