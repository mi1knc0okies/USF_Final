           This was a bit challenging trying to get my side columns to line up and be the proper length. Trying to adjust the minimum height to the same length across all the
            columns did not work one would be longer than the other even though they were set the same. I dont think I double-checked the spacing from the top but as of writing
            I am happy with where my webpage is. It has been a while since I made a layout from scratch so it was fun and very challenging to go this far as I have never had to do a
            layout with multiple columns setup through the css. I'm not very happy with the iframe sidebar for my links from a personal standpoint but I think it looks much better now
            than before. Getting the image map coordinates to line up was also a bit of a challenge and a bit time-consuming but I feel like the image map and the columns through css will
            be items that I will use in the near future in future projects. At first, I didn't understand where I would use the image map but I found a creative use for it as the entry
            page for my website. I hope that my professor finds it creative and fitting of his requirements.

            The thing I hate the most about iframes is that it is difficult to link to a page you want to go to while keeping the iframe menu without making an extra html page. Pretty inconvenient
            and a waste of time.
            <br>
            I definitely should of gave myself a little more time to work on this as I feel like I could have challenged myself a bit moe to make the website look the way I wanted it. Looking
            ahead at the next project and the fact it has javascript involved, I will definitely start a bit earlier.

            I have worked with old framesets in the past, and it was interesting trying to make iframes work in the way I want. Still some tinkering needed to really get
            the pages to look the way I want and not sure if the changes I want need to be done through the style sheet or directly in the html surrounding the iframe code.
            Something weird that I encountered was the order of the iframes causing me to not be able to click on my menu section. I spent easily 30minutes to maybe an hour trying
            to figure it out then just swapped the order of the code then suddenly it worked.
            <br>
            Outside of adding the framesets there was not much of a huge change or adjustment from what I had already submitted for SUS. I had already used an external style sheet
            in the first project so copying my style sheet to be placed as an internal style sheet saved me a lot of time. This was a pretty simple project but getting everything align
            correctly after implementing framesets took the majority of my time. I am looking forward to the next project.

            There is not a lot for me to reflect on in this project. I deal with coding and using FTP/SSH applications daily. I use a mac and prefer Cyber Duck or Fetch over
            Filezilla from having bad experiences with bloatware being installed with the program on Windows machines. For the most part this was a pretty straight
            forward exercise for me. It gave me a chance to brush up on a few skills I really haven't needed to use in a while.</p>

            This is the first time in a while that I have designed a website from scratch. I enjoyed it much more than taking an existing website template and trying to edit it
            to fit my needs. I am looking forward to our next project as this type of work is what I enjoy and why I am passionate about making a career out of it.

            After uploading my files to the site I noticed the images load a little slow. Not sure if that is a USF server issue or if maybe I should of used smaller image files.
        <br>
            I'll blame USF's servers for now.
